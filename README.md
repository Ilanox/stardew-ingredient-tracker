# Stardew Ingredient Tracker

A web tool that helps you track which cooking recipes you’ve made in Stardew Valley — and what ingredients you still need.

This app reads your Stardew Valley **save file** and compares it against all known cooking recipes, giving you a breakdown of:

- ✅ Completed dishes  
- ❓ Known recipes you haven't cooked yet  
- 🍳 Missing ingredients for each uncooked recipe  

Built with **React** and **JavaScript**, and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.
